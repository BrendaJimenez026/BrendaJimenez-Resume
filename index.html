        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Theater MajorðŸŽ­</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Brenda Jimenez, an accomplished and energetic Actress and individual with a solid history of achievement in play productions, scene work, and short film productions. 
          A motivated leader with strong organizational and prioritization abilities. Also, a self-directed actress who is comfortable interacting with people from all backgrounds. 
          A player who requires little to no supervision and thrives in creative environments works collaboratively and enthusiastically with whoever partnered with. 
          Motivated, energetic and skilled at public speaking, character building, and pathos skills to make the scenery more efficient.<br><br>

          As a student in UCR I am exploring more and gaining more knowledge on my major as I continue to study and participate in it. 
          As a TFDP major, I learn more than just my area of study or concentration. 
          I am attending UCR with a concentration in acting while still learning  about the other parts of theatre or performing arts and their creative processes. 
          As an actor, I also gained knowledge about the importance and the contribution of what makes a production possible with the input of directors, stage managers, producers, designers from set to costume and more.<br><br>
          
 	        As an actor, I learned how to analyze the play I am in through its background, its language, the characters and more than what is on the surface. 
 	        Not only did I learn how to be a part of my own creative process, such as developing the character I am portraying, but I learned about the other creative processes around me to better assist my growth as an actor. 
 	        For example, this past quarter in UCR, I took a class on stage managing, and although I am an actor, I took it to learn more about the other disciplines or creative processes that are part of the entertainment industry. 
 	        Stage managing helped me see and understand the importance of the work done before the outcome of the play. 
 	        Being here in UCR has taught me that there is a lot of work and labor put into a project or production, which we often do not see as audience members watching the outcome of the play. 
 	        Learning about stage management as an actor assisted me in knowing the play in and out, knowing the what, where, how and why of the production process, being attentive on how the play is being run and being accountable for each creative process.<br><br>
	        
	        As I continue my studies here in UCR, in other opportunities and abroad, I will continue to gain knowledge and experience to apply to my area of study. 
	        My background in theatre and acting  mostly comes from my highschool drama club and film club. Before theatre, I had trouble expressing myself  and presenting myself. 
	        However, In my mid-high school career, theatre and acting helped me with getting out of my comfort zone, public speaking and being myself through my creative processes which led me to continue to learn and grow as I attend UCR. 
	        As I continue to study there will be and have been obstacles or moments of hindering but it is the motivation of doing my best and knowing my capabilities and help me move foward.
